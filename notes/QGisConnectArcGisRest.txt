Connecting to ArcGIS "mapserver" layers
Although Arcgis servers can be configured to provide WMS and WFS services, they are often only configured to provide REST and SOAP services.

Raster arcgis "mapserver" layers
It is possible to connect to these layers in QGIS via the REST interface.
Firstly (and the most difficult part) you need to find the URL for the REST service for your layer. E.g. you might want to use a layer that is available in the ESRI "Maps for Personal Use" web map at: http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?useExisting=1
Hopefully with a little googling you will be able to find the address where you can browse the "ArcGIS services directory" of your favourite ArcGIS server. In this case it is: http://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/

Find the layer that you want, copy the url for the REST service, and now you have at least two options:
1. In the QGIS Python console, run this:
qgis.utils.iface.addRasterLayer("http://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/World_Imagery/MapServer?f=json&pretty=true","raster")
2. Create a gdal service description file, e.g. by running this in a terminal:
gdal_translate "http://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/World_Imagery/MapServer?f=json&pretty=true" s.xml -of WMS
You can now load this file into QGIS, e.g. by drag-and-drop.

Vector arcgis "mapserver" layers, "globeserver" layers and "featureserver" layers
There is no known way to connect to these layers via the REST interface.

For Oregon Explorer:

gdal_translate "http://imagery.oregonexplorer.info/arcgis/services" OregonExplorer.xml -of WMS

hmm does not work...
